      "body": "So far the [Quick Start section](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/quick_start/) in our Pinax documentation only shows how you can create a new project based on [pinax-project-account](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-project-account). Pinax projects are just Django projects and Pinax apps are just Django apps so you can add any Django app or any Pinax app to a Pinax starter project. We think it would be nice to show our users how to add one or two Pinax apps to their project after they got `pinax-project-account` up and running with the help of our Quick Start.\r\nWe'd like to give someone who has never contributed to open source before a chance to tackle this task in order to make their first OSS contribution. If you have contributed to open source before, please let someone else take this one. Below you can find some guidelines and instructions on what you need to do:\r\n\r\n* Read [this blog post](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2015/11/10/guide-how-contribute-pinax/) (especially the \"how to make a pull request section\") to learn what you need to to do set everything up.\r\n* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEO9sh-anCQ) and read [this blog post](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2015/11/25/recap-november-pinax-hangout/) (especially the \"adding apps to starter projects\" section) to learn more about `pinax-project-account` (what apps it consists of etc.) and how you can add apps to a Pinax project (or really any Django project).\r\n* Open the forked `pinax/pinax` repository in your text editor, then open the `docs` folder, and finally open the `quick_start.md` file.\r\n* At the very bottom of the file you should see this \"TODO: Then add one more app\". You can remove this line and add your description on how to add an app to a Pinax starter project. Don't forget to save your changes. Please note that we use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for our documentation.\r\n* Let's see what our changes look like. To do so type `mkdocs serve` into your terminal. Make sure you `cd'd` into the folder in which you copied your forked repository first. Then type `127.0.0.1:8000/` into your browser and you should see the Pinax documentation including the changes you made. Awesome!\r\n* Press the ctrl+c keys in order to stop the server, then follow the instructions (\"how to make a pull request\" section) [here](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2015/11/10/guide-how-contribute-pinax/) to learn how to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub and make a pull request.\r\n* Celebrate! You are now an open source contributor! 🎉\r\n\r\nOne of us will then review your pull request and if everything looks great we will merge it (you will receive an email notification from GitHub). If you need to make additional changes, we will comment on your pull request and help you figure out the next steps. Don't worry, this is totally normal and doesn't mean that your pull request isn't awesome. Sometimes it just happens that a few things need to be tweaked. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help, comment on this issue and mention me @ossanna16 (I will receive a notification this way). One of us will then reply and help you. It's even better if you would join our [Pinax Slack channel](http://slack.pinaxproject.com) (it's free). Someone is always there to help and answer any questions. If you'd like to reach me personally mention me @anna in our Pinax project Slack channel. Please remember that there are no stupid questions. We want to help you succeed and want to help you make your first open source contribution. 😊\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Right now the [Quick Start](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/quick_start/) in the [Pinax documentation](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/) and the [README of this repository](https://github.com/pinax/pinax/blob/master/README.md) still show the \"manual\" way of starting Pinax starter projects. Since there's now an easier way to do that with the Pinax Command Line ([pinax-cli](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-cli)) both of these documents need to be updated. We'd like to give someone who has never contributed to open source before a chance to tackle this task in order to make their first OSS contribution. If you have contributed to open source before, please let someone else take this one. Below you can find some guidelines and instructions on what you need to do:\r\n\r\n* Read [this blog post](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2015/11/10/guide-how-contribute-pinax/) (especially the \"how to make a pull request section\") to learn what you need to to do set everything up. \r\n* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4yVb9zrbuw#action=share) and read [this blog post](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2015/11/02/recap-october-pinax-hangout/) to learn how @brosner uses `pinax-cli` to install `pinax-project-blog`.\r\n* Open the forked `pinax/pinax` repository in your text editor and update the \"Getting Started\" section in the `README.md` file with the new `pinax-cli` way of starting projects. Don't forget to save your changes. Please note that we use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for our documentation.\r\n* In your text editor open the `docs` folder of the `pinax/pinax` repository and create a new file (right click \"New File\") named `quick_start_manual.md`.\r\n* Open the `quick_start.md` file, copy the content, and paste it into your new `quick_start_manual.md` file. At the very top of the file you should change the title \"Quick Start\" to \"Quick Start Manual\", then save the file.\r\n* Go back to the `quick_start.md` file and update the file the same way you updated the `README.md` file earlier to showcase the new `pinax-cli` way of starting projects.\r\n* We want people to know that there is also a \"manual way\" of starting a project, not only the `pinax-cli` way so you should add one sentence to the document letting people know that if they are interested in learning about the manual way of installing a Pinax project, they should visit the \"Quick Start Manual\" page of the documentation. It would be good if you would link to this page from the `quick_start.md` page. Don't forget to save your changes.\r\n* Since you created a new file, you need to add this file to the navigation bar of the documentation. To do that, open the file named `mkdocs.yml` and add the following line   `- [\"quick_start_manual.md\", \"Introduction\", \"Quick Start Manual\"]` right underneath this line `- [\"quick_start.md\", \"Introduction\", \"Quick Start\"]`. Save your changes.\r\n* You also need to add the new file to the table of contents in the documentation. To do that open the `index.md` file and add the following line `* [Quick Start Manaual](quick_start_manual.md)` right underneath the following line `* [Quick Start](quick_start.md)`. Don't forget to save your changes.\r\n* Let's see what our changes look like. To do so type `mkdocs serve` into your terminal. Make sure you `cd'd` into the folder in which you copied your forked repository first. Then type `127.0.0.1:8000/` into your browser and you should see the Pinax documentation including the changes you made. Awesome!\r\n* Press the ctrl+c keys in order to stop the server, then follow the instructions (\"how to make a pull request\" section) [here](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2015/11/10/guide-how-contribute-pinax/) to learn how to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub and make a pull request.\r\n* Celebrate! You are now an open source contributor! 🎉\r\n\r\nOne of us will then review your pull request and if everything looks great we will merge it (you will receive an email notification from GitHub). If you need to make additional changes, we will comment on your pull request and help you figure out the next steps. Don't worry, this is totally normal and doesn't mean that your pull request isn't awesome. Sometimes it just happens that a few things need to be tweaked. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help, comment on this issue and mention me @ossanna16 (I will receive a notification this way). One of us will then reply and help you. It's even better if you would join our [Pinax Slack channel](http://slack.pinaxproject.com) (it's free). Someone is always there to help and answer any questions. If you'd like to reach me personally mention me @anna in our Pinax project Slack channel. Please remember that there are no stupid questions. We want to help you succeed and want to help you make your first open source contribution. 😊\r\n",
